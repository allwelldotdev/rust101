# Learning Rust Programming 101

Coming from learning and using Python to build backend solutions, transform data, and automate processes (including cloud), I came across Rust--which Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, called "the perfect programming lanaguage."

In this repo are tinkle files from learnings and lab files of Rust (learning Rust via [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)).

For a more interactive learning experience, I also used a different version of the Rust Book, featuring: quizzes, highlighting, visualizations, and more: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/
