# Learning Rust Programming 101

Coming from learning and using Python to build backend solutions, transform data, and automate processes (including cloud), I came across Rust--which Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, called "the perfect programming lanaguage."

In this repo are tinkle files from learnings and lab files of learning Rust via two sources:
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition, by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendoff, and Leonara F. S. Tindall](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)

For a more interactive learning experience, I also used a different version of the Rust Book, featuring: quizzes, highlighting, visualizations, and more: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/

Files from **The Rust Book** are stored on the top-level directory or root directory, while files from **Programming Rust** are stored in the `00-programming_rust_book` directory.
